This repository hosts the build instructions and scripts for the JavaScript wrapper for the C++ library <strong>Antimony</strong> (https://github.com/sys-bio/antimony). Antimony is a human-readable, human-writable modular model definition language used in Systems Biology for modeling chemical networks. This library allows the user to easily convert Antimony models to SBML models (https://sbml.org) and vice-versa.
